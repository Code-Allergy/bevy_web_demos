CMPT485 Presentation Demos - Bevy Game Engine
By: Ryan Schaffer

This repository contains the demos for my presentation on the Bevy game engine.
The presentation is a brief overview of the Bevy game engine and its features,
as well as a demonstration of some of the features of the engine.

The demos are as follows:
001-basic-mesh - A demo that shows how to create a window and draw a primitive cube mesh.
002-basic-models - A demo that shows how to load and draw a 3D model.
003-assignment-1 - A demo recreating the first assignment from CMPT485.
004-complex-scene - A demo that shows loading a complex scene with multiple models and materials.
005-physics-balls - A demo that shows how to add physics to a scene with Bevy's rapier physics plugin.
008-post-processing - A demo that shows custom pipelines using a chromatic aberration fragment shader.
009-movable-object - A demo that shows interactable objects using Bevy's ECS system.
010-overball-game - A demo that shows a simple game where the player
                        controls a ball to roll over tiles and open doors.

# Running the Demos
To run the demos, you will need to have Rust installed.
You can install Rust by following the instructions at https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

To build and run a demo locally on your system, navigate to the root directory and run the following command:
cargo run --bin <demo-name>

For example, to run the basic mesh demo, you would run:
cargo run --bin 001-basic-mesh

If you would like to build the website yourself (for whatever reason), you can run the following command:
make RELEASE=1

You can also build and serve the website locally in dev mode by running:
make serve
